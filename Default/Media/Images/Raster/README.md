# Raster
Raster images are pixel-by-pixel images that output in the form of a very detailed pixel-grid as the image.
Many displays disguise pixels, or may even have pixels so small their are nearly indistinguishable even under close examination.
These image file-types consume alot of storage, but with tools like photoshop or more creative use of some more basic image manipulation software, one can achieve fantastic and photorealistic alterations in a photoedit in just a minute or two.
