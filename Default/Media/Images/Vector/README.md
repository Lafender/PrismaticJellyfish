# Vector Images
Vector graphics are encoded into simple files containing a list of points on a Matrix.
The Matrix has (w) width and (h) height.
Vector shapes are comprised of connected points, either connected by straight lines or by Bezier curves. The connected lines then combine to form a shape which may have a Fill colour and a Outline colour.
