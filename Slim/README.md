# Slim
Prismatic Jellyfish directories may not require gratuitous subfolders.
In this case, use a Slim directory structure instead.
## Recommended Use-Case
If : 
- all of your first level directories do not exceed 20 components within
- you do not require more than 2 layouts
- you only intend to use vector graphics and animations (NO RASTER or frame-by-frame video)
